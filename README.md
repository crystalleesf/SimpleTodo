## Notes

This was my first time developing an Android App! Althought the app is fairly simple, I learned a lot. I got the chance to revisit Java, since using it during AP Computer Science in high school (~ 3 years ago). I also learned the basics of Git and how to access it through the terminal and Android Studios. I would recommend this project for any beginners or those who want some app development experience!
